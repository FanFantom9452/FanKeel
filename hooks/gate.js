// PreToolUse on AskUserQuestion. It marks the moment a gate opened, so the time
// the user spent at it can be told apart from the time the session spent
// working. `hooks/resume.js` is already the other end of the pair, because an
// answer arrives as a tool result rather than as a prompt.
//
// Stop was the obvious hook for this and is the wrong one. It fires when Claude
// finishes responding, and a session pausing on a tool call has not finished
// responding — this pipeline's gate is a tool call, so Stop never fires at one.
//
// Same two rules as guard.js: exit 0 on every path, and cost nothing for a
// session that is not in the mode. It goes further on one — it never writes a
// decision at all. A PreToolUse hook that answers about a tool it has no opinion
// on is overriding the user's own permission rules, and this one has no opinion
// about any tool. It only notes the time.
